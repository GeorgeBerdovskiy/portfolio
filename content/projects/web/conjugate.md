Conjugate is a free web application that helps students learn Spanish conjugations with short quizzes. Users can either generate random quizzes by selecting the number of verbs and verb endings they wish to study or create their own study sets by manually selecting verbs from our collection (which contains around 500). These tools are a great way to improve conjugation skills or study for Spanish exams!  

Quizzes are in the form of a conjugation table that the user needs to fill. Whenever users conjugate a verb incorrectly, itâ€™s added to your challenge bank for more practice. Users can always remind themselves of the correct conjugation by clicking on that verb in their challenge bank or finding it on our dictionary page.  

Please visit {{< standard-anchor link="https://conjugatespanish.app" content="https://conjugatespanish.app" >}} to explore these features yourself, completely free!
