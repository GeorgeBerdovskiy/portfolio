Many popular Ruby on Rails charting libraries are essentially wrappers around JavaScript libraries and are typically rendered using HTML canvas elements. This results in lower performance, rendering issues, resizing problems, and severely limited styling.

PureChart solves all of these problems with a Rails "native" approach - it only uses Ruby, HTML, and CSS (as well as user-defined JSON or YAML style configuration files)! This provides developers with a wide range of styling options while shipping zero lines of JavaScript.
