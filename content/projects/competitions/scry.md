For DeveloperWeek 2021, I worked with my friends Shuzheng (Tom) Zhang and Jake Roggenbuck to build Scry, a web application that allows users to quickly view important information about their server (such as open ports, logins, and storage).

Scry includes a local server and client application. The server gathers data about the monitored server, and the client presents that data in an appealing, easy-to-read format. The server runs commands in the background to collect system information and stores it in a MongoDB database. The client is a ReactJS application that displays stored data in the userâ€™s web browser. I was responsible for creating the client while Jake built the backend, and Tom contributed to both.

Please visit our GitHub repository for the project {{< standard-anchor link="https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/Scry" content="here" >}} if you're interested!

The frontend was built using **ReactJS** while the backend was built using **FastAPI (Python)** and **MongoDB**.
