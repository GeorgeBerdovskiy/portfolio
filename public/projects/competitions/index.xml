      <description>Description For the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative Global Hackathon (2022), I worked with UCD computer science undergraduates Jake Roggenbuck and Terry Tong to build Plant Here, a web application that allows users to determine the best locations to plant their crops (or what kind of crops to plant in their location) based on rainfall and soil data for that region.
The most challenging obstacle we encountered was collecting the datasets from their respective AWS S3 buckets, as the file sizes were very large!</description>

      <description>Description For NASA Space Apps 2020, I worked with my friend Shuzheng (Tom) Zhang to build the HEASARC and NEOSSat Data Viewer. This Flask web application allows users to explore data about astronomical objects collected by NASA and the Canadian Space Agency.
Cosmic objects such as stars, galaxies, and asteroids are displayed on a rotating JavaScript sky map developed by Sonia Zorba. Users can click on an object they&amp;rsquo;re interested in, and detailed information about it will be displayed below.</description>

      <description>Description For DeveloperWeek 2021, I worked with my friends Shuzheng (Tom) Zhang and Jake Roggenbuck to build Scry, a web application that allows users to quickly view important information about their server (such as open ports, logins, and storage).
Scry includes a local server and client application. The server gathers data about the monitored server, and the client presents that data in an appealing, easy-to-read format. The server runs commands in the background to collect system information and stores it in a MongoDB database.</description>
