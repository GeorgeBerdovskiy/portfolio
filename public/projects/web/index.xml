      <description>Description Conjugate is a free web application that helps students learn Spanish conjugations with short quizzes. Users can either generate random quizzes by selecting the number of verbs and verb endings they wish to study or create their own study sets by manually selecting verbs from our collection (which contains around 500). These tools are a great way to improve conjugation skills or study for Spanish exams!
Quizzes are in the form of a conjugation table that the user needs to fill.</description>

      <description>Description Shelter Finder is a web application that helps first responders find beds for people without housing in local shelters, and is hosted by FRC Team 1678 Citrus Circuits as an outreach project.
Shelters can enter and update information about themselves, such as their address, hours, and the total number of beds offered. Shelter staff can use the counter feature to update the number of occupied beds. Depending on its needs, a shelter may choose to use a combination of male, female, nonspecific, and family counters.</description>
